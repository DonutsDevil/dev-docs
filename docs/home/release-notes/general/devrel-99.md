# Esper Release Notes - DevRel 99

Date: 11/22/2022
 
We’ve made significant improvements to Blueprints and our Esper API Support Tool (EAST). These improvements will continue to aid Esper users to better manage large device fleets.
 
Find a breakdown of the improvements below. 
 
## New Features

- We’ve begun rolling out our new Esper Single Sign-on (SSO) service. This is a standard service available to all Esper tenants, and using an SSO provider is optional. However, it does require a switchover for each Esper user. Accounts will be notified via email about how to transfer to the new service.
- We've made the following improvements to EAST: 
  - Added the ability to auto-schedule a report 
  - Added filtering preferences that allow users to display apps that show in the Device grid's Application column 
  - Added a "DNS" column to the Network grid 
  - Added nested device count to the Group selection dialog
  - Added the option to push or update App Version to Blueprints on a tenant 
  - Improved "Reports" generation for timing and grid loading 
  - Added the option to save larger device selections (5000+) for faster report generation
  - Added the ability to split up Spreadsheets with large amounts of data 
  - Added a preference to define the maximum number of rows that should be written in a sheet. The defaults are Max: 500K, Min: 50K. 
 
## Bug Fixes and Improvements

- In Blueprints, we’ve:
  - Improved the flow when it comes to editing and creating. 
  - Cleaned up the device filters.
  - Improved Group and Subgroup navigation.
  - Resolved a bug that caused managed configurations for preloaded apps to not take effect.
  - Fixed an issue where the Purchase button was sometimes offscreen when attempting to pay a bill within the console.


We’re excited to launch DevRel 99, and the Esper team is hard at work on the next release. Please contact [Esper Support](mailto:support@esper.io) to share your thoughts on how Esper can improve future releases.
