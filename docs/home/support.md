# Support

If you face any issues while using Esper, we are here to help you! Support options available to you depend on your Esper tier:

* Esper Starter - [Esper Support Forum]
* Esper Essentials - support@esper.io
* Esper Pro - Direct ticketing of support issues by customers

Esper Trial users receive 15 days of evaluation support after signup via support@esper.io. Please be sure to check our support forums first before emailing support. **After 15 days, the default support option will be the Esper Support Forum unless youâ€™ve purchased an Esper Essentials or Pro licensing pack.**
