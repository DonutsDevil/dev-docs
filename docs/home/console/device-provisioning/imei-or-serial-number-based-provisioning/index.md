# Seamless Provisioning OR IMEI based Provisioning

This method of provisioning can only be used if customer has chosen to get devices from Esper. Esper provides the option to recommend hardware devices which are baked in with Esper optimized Android OS known as Esper Enhanced Android. These devices are the easiest to provision as all information for provisioning is already baked into the OS of the device. All you need to do is boot the device.

If your device is running Esper Enhanced Android, please follow the below steps to use IMEI provisioning:

[IMEI - Esper Enhanced Android](esper-enhanced-android-os/index.md)

To know how to opt for Esper Enhanced devices, contact support@esper.io.
